## Dynamic Team Page - Plan

## Analizing:

We need a Team Page, that shows each member with their names and roles in the project.

## Coding:

CSS: Styles and hovers.

Javascript:
- Event where every time we click the member, his/her information appear in a container under the same.

- Conditional: If we click member A, and then member B, the information of member A should be hidden and the info of member B appears.
